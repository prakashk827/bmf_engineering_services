									Driving Behavior technology answers the need to educate drivers, while they drive, and simultaneously log their behavior for management and future use. The Driving Behavior technology includes a 3-dimentional black box application that provides accurate and relevant information regarding the driver’s activities and maneuvers before and during an accident event.

									ERM’s Driving Behavior distinguishes between different types of maneuvers, and reports violation according to the level of severity. The technology was designed for simple and fast implementation, and thus differentiate between different types of vehicles, allowing accurate reporting.

									During an accident event, the Driving Behavior technology automatically launches its black-box feature that logs 75 seconds before and after the impact. The data is registered in a very high sampling rate (1mS) including time stamp and location of each sample record, thereby enabling very accurate and detailed accident reconstruction and analysis for the fleet manager and/or insurance companies use.

It offers sophisticated event based tools to monitor, enquire, analyze and transmit information about the vehicle’s systems and sensors in real-time. The multi-protocol supported CAN Interface, enables a deep understanding of the numerous scenarios in a vehicle’s day to day activities.

 

ERM’s CAN Interface technology offer two main tools:
<ul>
	<li>Rule Engine - enables the fleet manager to set multi-dimensional CAN parameters rules, on which violation will trigger an event and send the relevant information in real-time to the fleet manager server resulting in considerably better controlling of the fleet’s operation and performances.</li>
 	<li>
	 Multi-Dimensional Histograms - enable deep analysis of particular situations during the vehicle's life.

									Fuel Monitoring technology is designed to alert, in real-time, of any fuel related event whether during ignition ON or OFF, and to assist in preventing vehicle fuel theft.

Fuel Monitoring technology is designed to read and analyze the data from fuel floats and fuel sensors. A special algorithm levels the data in order to present a steady consumption report similar to the fuel gauge, for any presentation layer in an application. Once leveled, the Fuel Monitoring technology will detect and alert irregular consumption events, such as fuel theft or refueling events.

By a unique mechanism the technology supports an automatic or manual calibration process. The information received is highly accurate and the fuel theft reports are presented in percentages or liters.

Using ERM’s Fuel Monitoring technology, fleet managers now have one less thing to worry about, as fuel theft detection and prevention has never been easier.

								We	developed several technologies for automotive security and cyber-attacks prevention for the automotive sector and the cyber-security market.

ERM’s patented technology for cyber-attacks prevention is designed to protect vehicles against ransomware and other cyber-attacks from external communication interfaces.

Cyber technology is suited for both OEMs and aftermarket implementations and is designed to protect against unauthorized breach through external communication interfaces such as an OBD plug, BT module, an infotainment system and similar.

For more traditional vehicle security protection, ERM has developed technology to delay the thieves as much as possible. The technology includes an immobilization system with a wireless interface, control over vehicle doors and windows and a set of sensors for towing alert and vehicle breach.

With ERM’s advanced Vehicle Security and Cyber technology, OEM’s and vehicle distributors can obtain direct communication with their customers for long-term periods, while securing their customer’s vehicle CANbus, preventing hacking, and monitoring breaches and towing attempts.

Fleet managers can benefit from after-market implementations of ERM’s technologies and have better protection while monitoring their vehicle fleets, receiving real-time alerts on each security related event.
